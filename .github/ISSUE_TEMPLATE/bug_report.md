If you report an issue, don't just report the composer error but be specific on versions, subpackages, replacement lines and how you got into this error. If you think you don't need to wipe out the `composer.lock` and `vendor/` folder, first carefully read the following: https://github.com/yireo/magento2-replace-tools Composer replacements require you to think differently about composer.
